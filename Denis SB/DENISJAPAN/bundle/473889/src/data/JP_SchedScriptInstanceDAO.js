             * Complete. This status indicates the script completed normally.
             * Deferred. This status indicates that the script is eligible for processing,
             *      but has not been processed due to processing constraints.
             *      For example, deferred status occurs when one job must wait for another job to finish.
             * Failed. This status indicates that the script has been processed, but failed to complete normally.
             *      If your script has failed, examine it for possible errors.
             * Pending. This status indicates that the script has been submitted and is waiting to be processed.
             * Processing. This status indicates the script is running.
             * Retry. This status indicates that the script entered the processing state,
             *      but failed to complete normally. In this case, the script is eligible to be retried. T
             *      he script will be retried automatically â€” you do not need to create a new deployment.
             *      Review the script execution log to help you determine why the script initially failed
             *      (for example, a timeout problem occurred).
